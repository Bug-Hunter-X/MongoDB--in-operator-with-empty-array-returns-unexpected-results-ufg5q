# MongoDB $in Operator with Empty Array

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error related to the MongoDB `$in` operator when used with an empty array. The query `db.collection.find({ field: { $in: [] } })` is expected to return all documents where the `field` exists, but it unexpectedly returns no results. This is because `$in` requires at least one element to work properly.

## Bug
The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous MongoDB query using `$in` with an empty array. 

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file shows different approaches to resolve this issue, demonstrating correct usage of the `$exists` operator and handling the case of an empty array.
